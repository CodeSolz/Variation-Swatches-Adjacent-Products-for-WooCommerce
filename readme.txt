== Description ==

Represent your online store as seen in physical store! An execellent sales increaser addons for WooCommerce Variation Swatches.

All the available variation swatches plugins will turn your store beautiful with color, images etc. 
When a user watches a product if we could show all the similar products to him, how cool that would be! 

Suppose, you go to a shop / store and want to see a specific color, designed product, the store / shop keeper can show you that immediately. 
You choose a design or color and ask the store / shop keeper for a different color or design. 
They will be able to show you immediately. But online you need to search a lot for the same thing. 

Here we come with our solution. When any customer is watching your product and they see a specific color or design, a similar color with a different 
designed product will be displayed immediately at the bottom of the product page. Isn't it cool?
So, clients can see instantly the different designs of the same color product without moving to different pages or websites.

<blockquote>
The most exciting thing is, this plugin doesn't require any settings so far!! So, it's kind of a plug and play software.
</blockquote>

Just download and install the plugin! Your store is ready to shine as a physical store! Currently this works on single product page only!
